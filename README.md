# Student Portal Demo
## This repository contains a basic idea and conceptual outline for a Student Portal application. The aim is to create a centralized platform where students can access academic information, manage their courses, view grades, communicate with instructors, and stay updated on university announcements.

## Core Features (Conceptual)
User Authentication: Secure login for students, instructors, and administrators.
Dashboard: Personalized overview for each user role.
Students: Quick access to upcoming assignments, recent grades, course schedules, and important announcements.
Instructors: View assigned courses, manage student lists, and post grades/announcements.
Administrators: Overall system management, user management, and course catalog administration.

## Course Management:
Course Catalog: Browse available courses.
Enrollment: Students can enroll in/drop courses.
Course Details: Access course syllabi, materials, and assignments.

## Grades & Transcripts:
View individual assignment and overall course grades.
Generate official academic transcripts.

## Communication:
Announcements: University-wide and course-specific announcements.
Messaging: Secure communication between students and instructors.
Profile Management: Students can update their personal information.

## Technology Stack (Proposed)
This is a conceptual outline, but a typical technology stack for such an application might include:
Frontend: React, Angular, or Vue.js for a dynamic user interface.
Backend: Node.js (Express), Python (Django/Flask), or Java (Spring Boot) for API development.
Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or MySQL for data storage.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for secure user authentication.

## Getting Started (Conceptual)
To set up this project (once implemented), you would typically:
https://github.com/DritiG/Student-Portal-Demo
Navigate to the project directory: cd student-portal-demo

## Install dependencies (e.g., npm install for Node.js/React projects).
Configure environment variables (e.g., database connection strings).
Run the application.

## Contribution
This is a starting point. Contributions, ideas, and suggestions for features or improvements are welcome!
